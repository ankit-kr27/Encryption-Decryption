# Encryption-decryption algorithm

### This is the functioning of the algorithm:-

> 1. It takes input from the user of the data that is to be encrypted.
> 2. The string data gets divided into multiple fragments of 5 elements each.
> 3. A random integer key array is generated of 5 elements.
> 4. Now the ASCII value of each character of each fragment gets altered with the key's respective values.
> 5. The result we get is the encrypted data.
> 6. And for decryption a similar process is applied just in the reverse order.Working on it, I got to learn a lot of things, besides the bug resolving session and all, it was a great experience overall.
